== Description ==

The WooCommerce Purchase Orders Plugin adds a new payment gateway option to your WooCommerce store, allowing customers to submit purchase orders by uploading PDF or DOCX files and providing a purchase order number. This plugin enhances the functionality of your store by streamlining the purchase order process and integrating it seamlessly into the existing WooCommerce system.

With this plugin, your customers can easily submit purchase orders instead of making immediate payments during checkout. This is especially useful for businesses, organizations, or institutions that prefer to use purchase orders for their procurement process. The uploaded files and purchase order numbers are then attached to the respective orders for convenient review and processing.

## Key Features

- Customers can upload PDF or DOCX files along with their purchase order.
- Customers can provide a purchase order number for reference.

## Usage

Once the WooCommerce Purchase Orders Plugin is installed and activated, customers can select the "Purchase Orders" option during checkout. They will be prompted to upload a PDF or DOCX file containing their purchase order and provide a purchase order number for reference.
